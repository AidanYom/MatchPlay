# MatchPlay

Note: create a bash file to run both at once.

## Run the Frontend Locally

`cd MatchPlayFrontend`
`npm start`

Then, download the Expo Go app on your personal device, and scan the QR code. Your phone and laptop must be on the same network. 

Note: Your devices may behave different on public networks. This is recommended on private networks.

There are limitations to testing with Expo, and installing Xcode may need to happen at some point. See more info here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. 

## Run the Backend Locally

`cd MatchPlayBackend`
`npm run test' - unit tests endpoints
'npm run dev' - runs the api on nodemon
'npm run start' - runs the api
